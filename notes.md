- GRT data doesn't include user IDs.
- [Stats: User Page](https://stats.usegalaxy.eu/d/000000012/galaxy-user-statistics?refresh=15m&orgId=1)
  includes user IDs, but these are extremely hard to attribute to an
  identifiable person. You must identify probably users of a tool (we have
  over 1.2k users) based on their research or some other property. And then there
  is nothing you can do with that ID since it isn't published anywhere else.

using user IDs is probably sufficient here. See above discussion, but it would
require a copy of the galaxy database which is not available except via access
from cn029, or via the database server itself.

Only PD we keep is email, making this easy. email is absolutely necessary
(post-workflow email notification, bug report communications, etc.)

As an admin I do not need to know a user's email address basically ever. This
could be hidden from me in a lot of places.

the only times that come to mind are:

- when I'm discussing a bug with a user and need to impersonate them (but their
  email is in the bug report email and I could use that for launching
  impersonation.)
- I'm testing something in a user who has previously permitted me to
  impersonate them.

So, basically, we could reduce the impersonate select box to an empty textbox
where we have to supply an email address. We could additionally allow users to
consent to impersonation, some users may not wish to. We could do this with
user preferences (and maybe giving us a nice way to link to it, so we could
write in an email "Hey, please allow me to impersonate you [link] and I'll
check out what's going on.")

- Need to check what all is based on consent.
- is ToS plain enough language?
- do we declare what we collect and why?

> Controllers that are part of a group of undertakings or institutions

So we're allowed to discuss people over email.

So IP address logs for 24 hours are OK under this. And we could really just
discard if we move to CA auth'd stuff.

This could probably be theoretically used to justify retaining email addresses
indefinitely? But I'm not sure and it doesn't really sit right with me. We
don't collect any other personal information (name, email) that this could be
used with.

OOOH This might be able to be used to justify giving access to an account when
the user departs the lab or so.

No idea what to do with this. Wish they gave concrete examples. We aren't
obligated to discover the identity of a natural person matching "jane-doe
<jane@example.com>" in our galaxy user database, but if they ... supply a
physical address? we cannot refuse to take this. I think. Not sure how the last
sentence even relates.

1 month to respond to emails.

So our login page should say "You are not legally obligated to supply your
name, you are free to choose a pseudonym to better protect your privacy."? Maybe?

I think this means we need to be very clear that when we enable OpenID Connect
authentication, that it is explicit that "OIDC users can update their
information there. We will obtain a username from that service to use with your
account"

Think we're safe from this too. No PD exposed to third parties.

I think this could be read as "when a user requests deletion and has shared
datasets with other users, we should remove the related datasets."

Or, maybe this isn't at that level since datasets aren't PD, but something
smaller like cleaning up roles, we're erasing members of a set without
affecting the rights of others.

My reading of this is that it does not affect our desire to automatically
decide where to send user jobs based on aspects about them. Because: there are
no legal effects, it does not significantly affect them, and the examples are
much stronger than just where to process data.

This seems like we shouldn't ever try to categories users as "genomics users"
or try to predict what tools they might be interested in. If we do, we'll need
to take a much closer look at this.

> where personal data are processed which reveal racial or ethnic origin,

If we allowed users to choose what news they wanted to see on their home page,
we probably couldn't really look at this data and see "oh, jane doe enabled
[left wing news source]" since that would revear her political opinions to us
and we don't need those for our processing. Or at least if we ever did look,
we'd have to be very sure to pseudonymise/anonymize first and only look at bulk
results.

Or maybe this is a better one to justify transferring user data to their boss?
We need to find a solid justification to that (in addition to written approval
by their boss.) (113) is sounding good as well except for "supervisory
authority needs to be informed." It would be optimal if we could share the
account data BUT mask all access to personal data.

Since we're resetting the password/changing the email on the account to make it
accessible, maybe this isn't something we need to worry about since no PD is
transferred. they are proving to us they know the identity of the user (via
their email address)

Need to check this.

Need to check this.

I interpret this to mean that we do not need a DPO:
- We are not a public authority.
- core activities do not require systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale
- we do not process SPD.
